## Introduction
Welcome to the third COSI data challenge (DC3)! The COSI data challenges are released on a yearly basis in preparation for the launch of the COSI Small Explorer (SMEX) class mission in 2027 ([Tomsick+23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230812362T/abstract)). They are based on simulated data, which is intended to closely mimic the real flight data. Every year the data challenges have increasingly more realistic source and background models, and they are analyzed with increasingly complete and matured analysis tools. In general there are two main goals of the data challenges:

1. Facilitate development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools.
   - With routine feedback from scientists. 
   - Alongside development of the expected source models by the science team. 
2. Provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data.
   - Excellent training for science team in preparation for first analyses after launch.
   - Public releases help with community building before COSI data is released. 

## Getting Started 
The only software requirement for DC3 is [cosipy](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy). A general introduction into cosipy, including installation instructions, can be found in the [cosipy-intro](cosipy-intro) directory. For a general introduction into analyzing data from Compton telescopes see [Compton-telescope-data-analysis-intro](Compton-telescope-data-analysis-intro). Note that cosipy is part of the larger COSITools, which is a broad collection of COSI data analysis tools, documentation, and verification data sets. COSITools can be installed by following the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-setup). This also includes MEGAlib, which is the main software program used for running simulations. However, unless you need MEGAlib and/or COSITools for other reasons, it's highly recommended to just install cosipy.    

This year's data challenge is based on 3 months of exposure time, for an equatorial orbit at an altitude of 530 km, with a pointing that rocks between $\pm 20^\circ$ from the Earth zenith. The simulated data products are provided in fits file format, and are hosted on wasabi. Details of the simulations, simulated data, and information for accessing the data products can be found in the [data-products](data-products) directory. 

The input models and challenges for DC3 were provided by the COSI science teams. There are challenges for the different science groups: GRBs, Positrons, Nucleosynthesis, Galactic, Extragalactic, Solar, and Dark Matter. These are described in detail in the [Data Challenges](#data-challenges) section below.  

In summary, to get started with DC3, install cosipy, familiarize yourself with the [data-products](data-products), and then start working through the [Data Challenges](#data-challenges), as described below. 

## System Requirements
One of our goals in developing cosipy is to make it easily accesible to all users. **All of the data challenges starting with DC2 should be doable on a laptop with at least 16 GB of RAM**. We are still working on optimizing the code, and so please let us know if you are running into memory issues.

## Getting Help
Please submit a new issue in the [cosipy](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy) git repository if you have issues with the code. If you have general feedback, or need further assistance, please reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team lead, Chris Karwin ([christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov)), the cosipy implementation lead, Israel Martinez-Castellanos ([israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov](israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov)), and the pipeline development lead Carolyn Kierans ([carolyn.a.kierans@nasa.gov](carolyn.a.kierans@nasa.gov)).

## Backgrounds
In general, observations in the MeV band are hindered by high backgrounds (both instrumental and astrophysical). In order to ensure that COSI accomplishes its main science goals, it is therefore crucial to have a firm understanding of these backgrounds. Although we are still in the early stages of development, with DC2 we have made significant progress in characterizing the background emission for COSI. Further details can be found in the [backgrounds](backgrounds) directory. 

For analyzing data in DC2, the backgrounds are modeled using the actual injected backgrounds themselves. This is the ideal case, where the backgrounds are perfectly known, which of course is not very realistic. In future data challenges we will be developing tools for estimating backgrounds when they are not perfectly known, as will be the case for the actual observations. 

## Earth Occultation
The Earth blocks a significant portion of the sky for satellites in low-Earth orbit, referred to as Earth occultation. It is important to account for this when simulating observations and performing data analysis. In order to implement this for the DC3 simulations we needed  to add new functionality to MEGAlib, as detailed in the [earth-occultation](earth-occultation) directory. **These new methods now allow for simulating instruments with non-zenith pointings.** We also added new methods in cosipy to account for Earth occultation in the data analysis.

## Computing Resources
<div align="center">
<img width="1050"  src="static/clusters.png">
<div align="left">
  
The simulations for the COSI data challenges are ran on high performance computing clusters. Most notably, we have made extensive use of NASA's [Discover cluster](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/discover), the [MOGON](https://mogonwiki.zdv.uni-mainz.de/docs/introduction/what_is_mogon) cluster in Mainz, and Clemson University's [Palmetto](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/) cluster. 

## Simulation Tools
The simulations employ [MEGAlib](https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib) via the Python-based COSI simulation pipepline, [cosi-sim](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-sim). Details regarding the specific MEGAlib versions and configuration files can be found in each respective data challenge directory. Model inputs for the simulations and the corresponding data challenges come from the COSI science team. All of the models used for past data challenges can be found in the source library of the cosi-sim tools ([link](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-sim/tree/main/cosi_sim/Source_Library)).

If you haven't worked with Jupyter before, you can find some help [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenge-2/tree/main/cosipy-intro/notebook_help.md)

As a very first step, try working through some of the example notebooks. Specific challenges for the different science topics are described below. You can start with whichever topic you are most interested in. Each challenge will refer you to a specific example notebook that will demonstrate the basic tools needed to complete the respective challenge. If you have completed the main challenges and are interested in further challenges, see the **Extra Challenges** section at the bottom of this page. 

All input models used for the simulations can be found in the DC2 source library of the COSI simulation pipeline, available [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenges/tree/main/cosi_dc/Source_Library/DC2/sources). This includes all the information about the injected sources, and it can be used for checking the results of the data challenges. 

**Orientation and Background Files:** <br />
All challenges use the same files: <br />
orientation file:  <br />
background file: 

## GRBs
 The tools needed to complete these challenges are demonstrated in the [GRB spectral fit](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/spectral_fits/continuum_fit/grb) and [GRB localization](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/ts_map) examples. 

The burst time for each GRB is specified with the data file. This is the minimum information needed to complete the challenges.

## Positrons
The tools needed to complete these challenges are demonstrated in the [511 imaging](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/image_deconvolution/511keV/ScAttBinning) and [511 spectral fit](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/spectral_fits/extended_source_fit) notebooks. 

Note: binned data products are also available for the 511 components. The file names are the same as listed above, but with "binned" instead of "unbinnned" and ".hdf5" instead of ".fits.gz". The binning matches the detector response, and has a time bin size of 7202.125 seconds. 

### Extragalactic Sources (LMC, M31, Virgo)
Internal ToDo (Sophie):
1. Proofread/check content
2. Provide links to cited papers

**Data Files:** <br />
LMC_Gaussian_511_3months_unbinned_data.fits.gz <br />
LMC_Gaussian_511_x100_3months_unbinned_data.fits.gz <br />
M31_Gaussian_511_3months_unbinned_data.fits.gz <br />
M31_Gaussian_511_x100_3months_unbinned_data.fits.gz <br />
Virgo_Gaussian_511_3months_unbinned_data.fits.gz <br /> 
Virgo_Gaussian_511_x100_3months_unbinned_data.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:** 
Fluxes are estimated by assuming that the 511 keV photon flux is proportional to the stellar mass of a source. Using a Milky Way 511 keV flux of $2.8 \times 10^{-3} \  \mathrm{ph \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$ (Siegert et al 2016) and total stellar mass of $5.4 \times 10^{10} \  M_\odot$ (McMillan et al 2016), we scale the 511 keV flux of each extragalactic source based on the 511 keV flux assumed to be associated with the stellar mass in the Milky Way.

The stellar masses are: <br />
LMC: $1 \times 10^{10} \ M_\odot\$ (Erkal et al 2019) <br />
M31: $1.25 \times 10^{11} \ M_\odot\$ (Tamm et al 2012) <br />
Virgo: $1.2 \times 10^{14} \ M_\odot\$ (Fouque et al 2001) <br />

We also include each source at 100x the nominal flux, in order to ensure that they are above COSI's 511 keV line sensitivity.

**Goals:**
1. Determine COSI's sensitivity for detecting these potential extragalactic 511 keV sources.
