## Introduction
Welcome to the third COSI Data Challenge (DC3)! The COSI Data Challenges are released on a yearly basis in preparation for the launch of the COSI Small Explorer (SMEX) class mission in 2027 ([Tomsick+23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230812362T/abstract)). They are based on simulated data, which is intended to closely mimic the real flight data. Every year the Data Challenges have increasingly more realistic source and background models, and they are analyzed with increasingly complete and matured analysis tools. In general there are two main goals of the Data Challenges:

1. Facilitate development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools
   - With routine feedback from scientists
   - Alongside development of the expected source models by the science team 
2. Provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data
   - Excellent training for science team in preparation for first analyses after launch
   - Public releases help with community building before COSI data is released

## Getting Started 
The only software requirement for DC3 is [cosipy](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy). A general introduction into cosipy, including installation instructions, can be found in the [cosipy-intro](cosipy-intro/README.md) directory. For a general introduction into analyzing data from Compton telescopes see [Compton-telescope-data-analysis-intro](Compton-telescope-data-analysis-intro/README.md). Note that cosipy is part of the larger COSITools, which is a broad collection of COSI data analysis tools, documentation, and verification data sets. COSITools can be installed by following the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-setup). This also includes MEGAlib, which is the main software program used for running simulations. However, unless you need MEGAlib and/or COSITools for other reasons, it's highly recommended to just install cosipy.    

This year's Data Challenge is based on 3 months of exposure time, for an equatorial orbit at an altitude of 530 km, with a pointing that rocks between $\pm 20^\circ$ from the Earth zenith. The simulated data products are provided in Fits file format, and are hosted on Wasabi. Details of the simulations, simulated data, and information for accessing the data products can be found in the [data-products](data-products/README.md) directory. 

The input models and challenges for DC3 were provided by the COSI science teams. There are challenges for the different science groups: GRBs, Positrons, Nucleosynthesis, Galactic, Extragalactic, and Dark Matter. These are described in detail in the [Data Challenges](#data-challenges) section below.  

Users are encouraged to post feedback on the [Discussions](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenges/discussions) page. This can include solutions to specific challenges, questions, issues, etc.

In summary, to get started with DC3, install cosipy, familiarize yourself with the [data-products](data-products/README.md), and then start working through the [Data Challenges](#data-challenges), as described below. 

## System Requirements
One of our goals in developing cosipy is to make it easily accesible to all users. **All of the Data Challenges should be doable on a laptop with at least 16 GB of RAM**. We are still working on optimizing the code, and so please let us know if you are running into memory issues.

## Getting Help
Please submit a new issue in the [cosipy](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy) git repository if you have issues with the code. If you have general feedback, or need further assistance, please reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team lead, Chris Karwin ([christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov)), the cosipy implementation lead, Israel Martinez-Castellanos ([israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov](israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov)), and the pipeline development lead Carolyn Kierans ([carolyn.a.kierans@nasa.gov](carolyn.a.kierans@nasa.gov)).

If you haven't worked with Jupyter before, you can find some help [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenge-2/tree/main/cosipy-intro/notebook_help.md).

As a very first step, try working through some of the example notebooks. It is highly recommended to start with the dataIO notebook, as this describes the general handling of COSI data, and it is needed for almost all other notebooks. Specific challenges for the different science topics are described in the links below. You can start with whichever topic you are most interested in. Each challenge will refer you to a specific example notebook that will demonstrate the basic tools needed to complete the respective challenge. If you have completed the main challenges and are interested in exploring other models, you can employ the source injector (see the [Source injector](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/develop/docs/tutorials/source_injector) example). If you are interested in getting more involved in the cosipy development, see the [Known Caveats and Limitations](#known-caveats-and-limitations) section at the bottom of this page, as well as the bottom of the [cosipy-intro](cosipy-intro/README.md), which outlines some of the priority areas for the next stages of development. 

All input models used for the simulations can be found in the DC3 source library of the COSI simulation pipeline, available [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-sim/tree/main/cosi_sim/Source_Library/DC3). This includes all the information about the injected sources, and it can be used for checking the results of the data challenges. 

**Orientation Files:** <br />
Two orientation files are available: <br />
DC3_final_530km_3_month_with_slew_15sbins_GalacticEarth_SAA.ori  <br />
DC3_final_530km_3_month_with_slew_1sbins_GalacticEarth_SAA.ori  <br />
The 1 second binning may be optimal for analyzing transients on short time scales, but generally the 15 second binning should be sufficient and is considered the default. 

**Background Modeling:** <br />
For analyzing data in DC3, the starting point is to model the backgrounds using the actual simulated backgrounds themselves. This is the ideal case, where the backgrounds are perfectly known, which of course is not very realistic. To simplify the analysis, it is sometimes helpful to start with just a single background component (e.g. albedo photons), and then move on to the total background after everything is working. The next step is to estimate the backgrounds. **With DC3 we have new methods to estimate the background for both line and continuum sources**. The background estimation tool for line emission can be used for both point sources and extended sources. An example tutorial can be found in the [line background estimation](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/background_estimation/line_background/line_background_estimation_example_notebook.ipynb) notebook. The background estimation tool for continuum emission is currently only available for point sources. An example tutorial is available in the [continuum background estimation](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/background_estimation/continuum_estimation/BG_estimation_example.ipynb) notebook. We stress that both of these background estimation algorithms are only first versions, and further development and testing is still needed. More details are provided in the respective example tutorials. 

The available background files are listed in the [data-products](data-products/README.md) directory. We provide a file with the total background, as well as separate files for the individual background components (as details in the [backgrounds](backgrounds/README.md) directory).

 **Input Models:** <br />
 All input models can be found [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-sim/tree/main/cosi_sim/Source_Library/DC3/sources/GRBs).
 
 The GRBs occur randomly within the orientation file, with their positions chosen such that they have incidence angles under $60^\circ$. The spectra are described with Band functions, and the parameters are based on fits to GBM data. Likewise, the lightcurves are also from GBM data. The fluxes were chosen such that some GRBs have a minimum detectable polarization (MDP) below their polarization fraction, and some have a MDP above. The models are specified below, including the polarization fraction (PF), and the polarization angle (PA) given in IAU convention. We also provide burst times, which is needed for the analysis:

## Positron Data Challenges
The tools needed to complete these challenges are demonstrated in the [511 imaging](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/image_deconvolution/511keV/ScAttBinning) and [511 spectral fit](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/spectral_fits/extended_source_fit) notebooks. 

**All challenges should use the same detector response files:** 
Response511.o4.e509_513.s20881894470591.m2555.filtered.nonsparse.binnedimaging.imagingresponse_nside16.area.h5.gz <br />
ResponseContinuum.o3.e100_10000.b10log.s10396905069491.m2284.filtered.nonsparse.binnedimaging.imagingresponse_nside8.area.h5.gz <br />
extended_source_response_511_merged.h5.gz (precomputed 511 extended source response file)
extended_source_response_continuum_merged.h5.gz (precomputed continuum extended source response file)

The line response is for analyzing the 511 keV line emission, and the continuum response is for analyzing the orthopositronium continuum. Currently, these two components cannot be analyzed simultaneously, as desribed in the [Known Caveats and Limitations](#known-caveats-and-limitations) section. 

### Extragalactic Sources (LMC, M31, Virgo)

**Data Files:** <br />
LMC_Gaussian_511_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
LMC_Gaussian_511_x100_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
M31_Gaussian_511_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

Virgo_Gaussian_511_x100_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
Fluxes are estimated by assuming that the 511 keV photon flux is proportional to the stellar mass of a source. Using a Milky Way 511 keV flux of $2.8 \times 10^{-3} \  \mathrm{ph \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$ ([Siegert+16](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/02/aa27510-15/aa27510-15.html)) and total stellar mass of $5.4 \times 10^{10} \  M_\odot$ ([McMillan+16](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/465/1/76/2417479)), we scale the 511 keV flux of each extragalactic source based on the 511 keV flux assumed to be associated with the stellar mass in the Milky Way.

The stellar masses are: <br />
LMC: $1 \times 10^{10} \ M_\odot\$ ([Erkal+19](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/487/2/2685/5491315)) <br />
M31: $1.25 \times 10^{11} \ M_\odot\$ ([Tamm+12](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/10/aa20065-12/aa20065-12.html)) <br />
Virgo: $1.2 \times 10^{14} \ M_\odot\$ ([Fouque+01](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2001/33/aa1326/aa1326.html)) <br />

We also include each source at 100x the nominal flux, in order to ensure that they are above COSI's 511 keV line sensitivity.

**Goals:**
1. Determine COSI's sensitivity for detecting these potential extragalactic 511 keV sources. 

### Globular Clusters (Tuc 47, Omega_Cen, NGC 6121, NGC_6397)

**Data Files:** <br />
Globular_Cluster_Tuc_47_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
Globular_Cluster_Omega_Cen_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
Globular_Cluster_NGC_6397_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
Globular_Cluster_NGC_6121_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
The 511 keV photon flux for the brightest 4 globular clusters is presented here. The flux is estimated based on the 0.1 - 100 GeV luminosity from the Globular clusters, nuclear bulge emission, and boxy bulge emission in the Milky Way [Bartels et al 2018a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018NatAs...2..819B/abstract). The GeV luminosity of the Bulge is compared to the 511 keV luminosity of the bulge [Bartels et al 2018b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.480.3826B/abstract). This GeV luminosity vs 511 keV luminosity correlation is applied to the GeV excess observed from globular clusters [Zhang et al 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459...99Z/abstract) in the Galaxy to estimate the 511 keV flux of the globular clusters. The flux values shown here are 3x the values estimated from the correlation in order to make them within COSI's sensitivity limit.

**Goals:** <br />
1. Determine COSI's sensitivity for detecting 511 keV emission from Globular clusters.

### Positrons from 26Al

**Data Files:** <br />
Positrons_from_26Al_line_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
Positrons_from_26Al_cont_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
This is the description of the model of the diffuse emission due to the steady state annihilation of positrons produced by 26Al decay in our Galaxy. The spatial distribution is derived from the calculation of the propagation of positrons in our Galaxy. The initial positions of positrons follow the model NE2001 of [Cordes & Lazio 2002](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207156) that fits the distribution of massive stars in our Galaxy, with a fraction of 26Al in the bulge of 2%. The positron propagation method is described in [Alexis et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...564A.108A/abstract). The spectral distribution takes into account the annihilation line and the orthopositronium continuum. It was obtained from the model of [Guessoum et al 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...436..171G/abstract) that compute a spectrum for each phase of the interstellar medium. The spectral model was corrected by the Galactic rotation using the model of [Fich, Blitz and Stark 1989](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...342..272F/abstract) for R > 3 kpc and a solid rotation model for R < 3 kpc.

**Goals:** <br />
1. Detection of the diffuse line and continuum emissions
2. Detection of the Doppler shift in the disk
3. Detection of the spectral shape
4. Correlation with the 26Al map (1809 keV emission)

### Positrons from 44Ti

**Data Files:** <br />
Positrons_from_44Ti_line_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
Positrons_from_44Ti_cont_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
This is the description of the model of the diffuse emission due to the steady state annihilation of positrons produced by 44Ti decay in our Galaxy. The spatial distribution is derived from the calculation of the propagation of positrons in our Galaxy. The initial positions of positrons follow the model NE2001 of [Cordes & Lazio 2002](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207156) that fits the distribution of massive stars in our Galaxy, with a fraction of 44Ti in the bulge of 2%, which corresponds to the fraction of massive stars also used for the 26Al. The positron propagation method is described in [Alexis et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...564A.108A/abstract). The positron rate due to 44Ti decay is $\sim 3 \times 10^{42}$ e+/s (see section 2.3 of Alexis et al. 2014).
The spectral distribution takes into account the annihilation line and the orthopositronium continuum. It was obtained from the model of [Guessoum et al 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...436..171G/abstract) that compute a spectrum for each phase of the interstellar medium. The spectral model was corrected by the Galactic rotation using the model of [Fich, Blitz and Stark 1989](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...342..272F/abstract) for R > 3 kpc and a solid rotation model for R < 3 kpc.

26Al_Cyg_Region_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
The characteristics of the emission were obtained from the analyses of INTEGRAL/SPI observations
described in [Martin+09](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...506..703M/abstract). The source is modeled with a $3^\circ$ width (standard deviation) Gaussian shape emission centered
at $l = 81^\circ, b = 1^\circ$. The line flux is $3.9 \times 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{ph \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$. It is centered at 1808.8 keV and its width is 1.6 keV (FWHM)
due to the interstellar turbulence.

**Goals:** <br />
1. Make detection taking into account the Galactic diffuse continuum background at 1809 keV emission
2. Measure width of the gamma-ray line
3. Recover 60Fe/26Al ratio (see 60Fe_Cyg_Region)

26Al_NE2001_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
This is the description of the model of the 1809 keV line diffuse emission due decay of 26Al in our Galaxy. The spatial distribution is derived from the model NE2001 of [Cordes & Lazio 2002](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207156) that fits
the distribution of massive stars in our Galaxy. The fraction of 26Al in the bulge is 2%. This value is a compromise between SPI observations and results of studies of star formation rate in this region.
The shape of the line in each spatial bin takes into account the turbulence of the interstellar medium and the Galactic rotation using the model of [Fich, Blitz and Stark 1989](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ApJ...342..272F/abstract) for R > 3 kpc and a solid rotation model for R < 3 kpc.

**Goals:** <br />
1. Detection of the diffuse emission

**Input Models:**  <br />
In all 4 scenarios, bulk center of motion is at rest. Doppler broadening is limited to 1000 km/s, as otherwise, when combined with the Doppler shifts of clumps, the signal will fall quite outside the DC2 simulated response region of 1143-1171 keV.

In asymmetric scenarios, Clump 1: Contains 2/3 of total 44Ti yield Doppler shifted towards from the observer (blueshifted). Has peak energy higher than 1157 keV. Clump 2: Contains 1/3 of total 44Ti yield Doppler shifted away from the observer (redshifted). Has peak energy lower than 1157 keV.

All spectra follow simple Gaussian distributions. The flux is taken as the value between $2.1 \times 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{ph \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$ in Grefenstette et al 2015 and $3.5 \times 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{ph \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}}$  in Siegert et al 2015.

described in [Martin+09](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...506..703M/abstract).

  ## Galactic Data Challenges
The tools needed to complete the Galactic challenges are demonstrated in the [Crab spectral fit](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/spectral_fits/continuum_fit/crab), [Crab imaging](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/image_deconvolution/Crab/ScAttBinning), [GRB localization](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/ts_map), [Polarization (ASAD method)](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/polarization/ASAD_method.ipynb), and [511 spectral fit](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy/tree/main/docs/tutorials/spectral_fits/extended_source_fit) (for extended source analysis) notebooks.

**All challenges should use the same detector response file:** <br />

### Galactic diffuse continuum

**Data Files:** <br />
GalTotal_SA100_F98_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz

**Input Models:**  <br />
The Galactic diffuse continuum emission is modeled using the v57 release of the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) propagation and interstellar emissions framework [(Porter+22)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac80f6). GALPROP self-consistently calculates spectra and abundances of Galactic CR species and associated diffuse emissions (gamma rays, X-rays, and radio) in 2D and 3D. The v57 release includes a set of steady-state emission model examples that reproduce the latest CR data. There are six models in total, categorized according to the CR source and interstellar radioation field (ISRF) model used for the prediction. There are 3 CR source models (SA0, SA50, SA100) and two ISRF models (R12, F98). The CR source density models are based on the distribution of injected CR power, with SA0 describing an axisymmetric disk (following the radial distribution of pulsars), SA50 describing a 50/50% split of the injected CR luminosity between disk-like and spiral arms, and SA100 describing pure spiral arms. All models have the same exponential scale height of 200 pc. The two ISRF models employ different spatial densities for both the stars and the dust but produce intensities very similar to those of the data for near- to far-infrared wavelengths at the location of the solar system (see [Porter+17](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa844d) and references therein). For the neutral gas distributions (atomic and molecular), a 3D model from [Johannesson+18](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab26e) is employed. These GALPROP models include the total emission, which is dominated by inverse Compton radiation, but also has a small contribution from Bremsstrahlung towards the upper energy bound. As our representative case, for DC3 we simulate the SA100-F98 model. 

This is the first data challenge to include the Galactic diffuse continuum, and our corresponding goals this year are straight forward. Future data challenges will look more into the different model variations and key parameters. 

**Note that the Galactic diffuse continuum emission is also part of the standard background model for COSI, which will be employed for most analyses.**

**Goals:** <br />
1. Measure the spectrum of the Galactic diffuse continuum emission, extracting it from the rest of the background
2. Image the Galactic diffuse continuum emission in the COSI energy band
3. Characterize how the the Galactic diffuse continuum emission impacts the sensitivity for point sources in the Galactic plane
   
### Gamma-ray Binary PSR B1259-63

**Data Files:** <br /> 
PSRB1259_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />
PSRB1259_10x_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz <br />

**Input Models:**  <br />
PSR B1259-63 is a binary gamma-ray system consisting of a radio pulsar and a massive Be-type star. The system has a highly eccentric orbit, with an orbital period of 3.4 years. Gamma-ray emission occurs during its periastron passage, as interactions between the outflows of the two objects trigger particle acceleration. The next periastron passage will be November 19th, 2027, making this a prime target for COSI. The model for DC3 is based on the work in [Abdo+11](https://doi.org/10.1088%2F2041-8205%2F736%2F1%2Fl11) (see model 1 in the bottom of Figure 5). For the DC3 simulations, the following features are assumed: 1) Constant emission for 30 days. 2) Two flux scenarios: the nominal value from Abdo+11, as well as a 10x enhanced flux. Note that in general the flux and duration vary for each periastron passage, and in COSI's energy band they are not well understood.

**Goals:** <br />
1. Measure MeV gamma-ray flux during the flare event.
2. Determine the duration of flare periods.

### GRS 1758-258

**Input Models:**  <br />
The two spectral models for Cyg X1 are best fit eqpair  models of time averaged INTEGRAL data [Cangemi+21]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...650A..93C/abstract) given for hard and soft states respectively. Polarization is also included. The hard state model is based on the measurements of [Rodriguez+2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...807...17R/abstract). At low energy (0.1 - 0.4 MeV) the polarization fraction is 5% with an angle of 40 degrees (IAU convention). At high energy (0.4 - 10 MeV) the polarization fraction is 75% with the same angle. The soft spectral state assumes an energy-independent polarization of 20% (same angle).  

**Goals:** <br />
1. Check detection sensitivity in soft state
2. Test how well COSI can monitor for spectral transitions

1E1740_twocompt_3months_unbinned_data_filtered_with_SAAcut.fits.gz

**Input Models:**  <br />
The 2 spectral models for 1E1740.7-2942 (also know as great annihilator) are the best fit models
 of INTEGRAL data obtained by [Bouchet+09](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/693/2/1871/pdf):
 - compow: thermal comptonization + power law
 - twocompt: two components of thermal comptonization with different temperatures
Both models represent the INTEGRAL data well but strongly differ at the highest energies. 

**Goals:** <br />
1. Test whether COSI would be able to distinguish between the two models.

**Input Models:**  <br />
The spectral models for MAXI J1820+070 and MAXI J1348-630 are scans of published INTEGRAL data shown in Fig 3 of [Cangemi+23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...669A..65C/abstract), in the hard state. The polarimetric models corresponds to the measurements shown in table 3 of the same paper. The input polarization models are divided into a low energy component (0.1 - 0.4 MeV) and a high energy component (0.4 - 10 MeV). MAXIJ1820+070 and  MAXI J1348-630 remained in the hard state for 60 days and 7 days, respectively, and for DC3 we have the sources 'on' for these respective times and off for the rest of the time. 

**Goals:** <br />
1. Test COSI's ability to measure spectra and polarization of transient sources.

## Known Caveats and Limitations
The items listed here are some of the priorities for DC4 development. These can be considered as extra/advanced challenges, and anybody is welcomed to work on them, with the ultimate goal of implementing the software solutions into cosipy. Also see the bottom of the [cosipy-intro](cosipy-intro) for a related discussion on the next steps of development.

- **It is not currently possible to simultaneously fit continuum and line components.** We have separate response files for different emission components (i.e. continuum, 511 keV, Aluminum-26, etc.), and with the current binned analysis setup in cosipy, the data binning needs to match the response binning, and thus only a single component can be analyzed at a time. Possible solutions to this include:
  - Creating a single response for all components
  - Creating a class that automatically matches an input model with the corresponding response
  - Reparameterizing the response in such a way that prevents this issue 
- **Methods need to be developed to determine the response for broadened and offset line emission.** These methods should utilize the baseline response files (e.g. 511 keV, Aluminum-26, Iron-60, etc.), and allow for analyzing any arbitrary line emission.
- **The background estimation tools need to be further tested and developed.** With DC3 we have provided first versions for estimating continuum and line backgrounds. These methods need to be tested, stressed, and further developed. Additionally, we still need background estimation tools for transient sources.
- **The way in which parameters are configured needs to be refined, and callable scripts need to be added.** By callable scripts we are referring to command-line options that will perform common task, such as producing light curves and spectra.  
- **The tools still need to be stressed to find limitations.** The COSI pipeline team has been rapidly developing the cosipy library in preparation for the satellite mission. Our aim is to make this library robust, sustainable, and highly user-friendly. Through more and more user interactions and feedback, we can better learn where the code is working well, and where it breaks down.

  - First (alpha) release of cosipy. 
  - Data challenges for all the main science groups (none for dark matter and solar).
  - All models and challenges provided by respective COSI science teams.
  - Uses 3 months of observations, for an equatorial orbit at 550 km, with a zenith pointing. 
  - All BG components are included, except for SAA passage (i.e. trapped cosmic rays).
    - BG also includes time variability from changing geomagnetic cutoff.
  - We simulated 12 background components, and 30 unique sources, running 49 different source simulations in total (using multiple models for some of the sources).
  - Contains 7 main tutorials demonstrating all the tools/methods needed for completing the challenges, included as part of the cosipy release:
    - dataIO
    - GRB localization
    - GRB spectral fit
    - Crab spectral fit
    - 511 spectral fit
    - Crab imaging
    - 511 imaging

 - Focused on COSI SMEX mission.
  - Data challenges for all the main science groups (including dark matter), covering all of COSI's primary science objectives. 
  - All models and challenges provided by respective COSI science teams.
  - Used 3 months of observations, for an equatorial orbit at 530 km.
  - Simulations include rocking of instrument:
    - Pointing changes between +/- 22 degrees every 12 hrs, with 8 minute transition time. 
  - Used detailed COSI SMEX mass model.
  - Simulated all background components in low-Earth orbit, including variability from geomagnetic cutoff, long-term buildup, and full SAA passage.
    - Background also includes the Galactic diffuse continuum for the first time. 
  - New methods in both MEGAlib and cosipy to account for Earth occultation with a non-zenith pointing. 
  - First time including polarization.
  - Numerous improvements to cosipy:
    - First version of source injector.
    - New implementation of Earth occultation in point source response.
    - First polarization tools.
    - New methods to estimate the background for continuum sources and line sources.
